Installation
############

A setup.py file is provided with pyJac. To install pyJac, call

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py install

You can also easily install (including dependencies) using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyjac

If installing via ``pip``, necessary Python dependencies will be installed if
not already present.

However, you will also need to separately install `Cantera`_ to read mechanism
files in that format or run the partially stirred reactor (PaSR) module
(``pyjac.functional_tester.partially_stirred_reactor``).

Please let us know if you run into trouble installing pyJac.

=======
Testing
=======

Functional testing of the routines generated by pyJac (provided by the
``pyjac.functional_tester`` module) requires the installation of `Adept`_,
a C++-based automatic differentiation library. For now, this should be
installed into ``/usr/local/include``.
